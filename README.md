Alternatively, here are some shortcuts for viewing the presentations directly in your browser:

1. [Orientation](https://raw.githack.com/hollina/ehec-intro-to-r/master/orientation/orientation.html). A short slide deck covering some basics and nice-to-knows before we dive into actual examples.

2. [Intro notebook](https://raw.githack.com/hollina/ehec-intro-to-r/master/notes/introduction-notes.html). The main notebook, with a couple of worked examples (incl. data manipulation, graphing, and simple regressions).

3. [Intro slides](https://raw.githack.com/hollina/ehec-intro-to-r/master/notes/introduction-slides.html). The slides presented, which are a subset of the material from the main notebook (previous bullet point). These mostly exist to provide an example of how to produce slides using R Markdown.

4. [R in Real Life](https://raw.githack.com/hollina/ehec-intro-to-r/master/kelli/EHEC_R.pdf). Evidence from Kelli's job market paper.
